TEOS-10 V3.06 GSW Oceanographic Toolbox in C
============================================

This began as a translation of the original Fortran-90 source code into C.  Unlike
the Fortran-90 and Matlab versions of the toolbox, functions in the C version
are primarily scalar.  You should download the documentation from
http://teos-10.org, but should look at gswteos-10.h for the C API.

The functions gsw_saar and gsw_deltasa_atlas have been modified from the
original to not use an external data file for global absolute salinity
anomaly and absolute salinity anomaly ratio data. The data are instead
incorporated into static variables that are used directly.

Usage (Unix / make):
--------------------

The C GSW Oceanographic Toolbox comes with a testing program, gsw_check.  In the
directory that the toolbox was unpacked, type:

    make

and it will attempt to build gsw_check with a dynamically-linked GSW library.
Note that the Makefile assumes that your C compiler is gcc.

If gsw_check builds successfully, run it to test the toolbox:

    ./gsw_check

Usage (Windows / nmake):
------------------------
In the directory that the toolbox was unpacked, type:

    nmake

and it will attempt to build gsw_check with a dynamically-linked GSW library.
Note that Developer Command Prompt for VS should be used or compiler paths
should be set manually.

If gsw_check builds successfully, run it to test the toolbox:

    gsw_check.exe

Usage (meson build system):
---------------------------

We provide a meson.build file (https://mesonbuild.com/) for GSW-C that works
on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
To setup a build directory and install the library and headers:

    meson setup builddir
    meson install -C builddir

This will install gswteos-10.h, a shared library libgswteos-10 and a package
config file gswteos-10.pc.

Meson can be configured with options like prefix, default_library etc.:

    meson setup builddir -Dprefix=/usr/local -Ddefault_library=static -Dbuildtype=release
    meson install -C builddir

For more options see mesonbuild.com. To run the tests use:

    meson test -C builddir -v


Notes:
------

C programs using the GSW Oceanographic Toolbox should include the
supplied header file:

    #include <gswteos-10.h>

You'll probably want to build gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c, and gsw_saar.c
into a library. "make library" will attempt to build a shared library for
gcc/GNU Linux platforms.
