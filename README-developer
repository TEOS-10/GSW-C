This document describes the organization of TEOS-10/GSW-C on github, and
gives instructions for contributors.

Files for development
=====================

README-developer        -- This file.
GNUmakefile             -- GNU make makefile used to manage the building
                            and maintenance of the gsw_c_v3.05.zip file on
                            teos-10.org, as well as RPMs for RedHat Linux
                            systems.
gsw_data_v3_0.nc        -- A redundant and hopefully current version of
                            the netcdf file hosted on github as
                            TEOS-10/datafile. gsw_check_data.c and
                            gsw_saar_data.c are generated from this file
                            using the supplied utilities
                            make_check_data.py and make_saar_data.py.
make_check_data.py      -- Utility to generate gsw_check_data.c from
                            gsw_data_v3_0.nc.
make_saar_data.py       -- Utility to generate gsw_saar_data.c from
                            gsw_data_v3_0.nc.
libgswteos-10.spec.proto
                        -- template used to create libgswteos-10.spec,
                            the configuration file for rpmbuild on RedHat
                            Linux platforms.


The file GNUmakefile is supplied for use on Linux/GNU systems. It has two
major purposes:

    * To build a zip archive of the distribution suitable for TEOS-10.org; and
    * To set up a versioned source distribution suitable for building source
      and binary RPMs on RedHat-like Linux systems.

Please note that the current distribution on teos-10.org
(http://teos-10.org/software/gsw_c_v3.05.zip) is a subset of this github
directory and is accurately described by the supplied README file.

Notes for contributors
======================

It is anticipated that the primary use for this C library will be
to provide core functionality in the GSW-Python and GSW-R libraries.

If additional core GSW functions are added here, they should be consistent
with their GSW-Matlab versions and with the general style of functions
presently in the C library.  Pull Requests for new functions should
include the corresponding tests in gsw_check_functions.c and test data in
gsw_check_data.c.  The latter should be the result of re-running the
make_check_data.py utility; gsw_check_data.c should not be hand-edited.

Code style for C should be generally consistent with the existing code
with respect to brackets and indentation, with the proviso that new
code should use 4-space indentation.  There should be no trailing
whitespace, and no tab characters.

Originally, gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c was assembled by a script from
individual files for each exported function, and the files were sorted
alphabetically.  When adding new exported functions, please insert them
alphabetically so as to maintain this (arbitrary) convention.  Support
functions, declared as "static", should be kept together with the
exported functions in which they are used, so they typically will not
be in alphabetic order.
