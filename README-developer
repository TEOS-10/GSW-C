This document describes the organization of TEOS-10/GSW-C on github.

Manifest:

GNUmakefile			-- GNU make makefile used to manage the building
				   and maintenance of the gsw_c_v3.05.zip file on
				   teos-10.org, as well as RPMs for RedHat Linux
				   systems.  Unlike Makefile, it builds the library source,
				   gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c from the files in the toolbox
				   subdirectory.  It can also build with debug settings.  See
				   below.
gsw_check_data.c		-- static check data used by
				   gsw_ check functions.c
test_strf_1.c      -- A simple function for testing gsw_geo_strf_dyn_height_1.c.
gsw_check_functions.c		-- C implementation of the check functions used
				   to validate the correct building of the GSW-C
				   Oceanographic Toolbox.
gsw_data_v3_0.nc		-- A redundant and hopefully current version of
				   the netcdf file hosted on github as
				   TEOS-10/datafile. gsw_check_data.c and
				   gsw_saar_data.c are generated from this file
				   using the supplied utilities
				   make_check_data.py and make_saar_data.py.
gsw_internal_const.h		-- Common parameters used to compile the GSW-C
				   library.
gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c	-- The distribution source code for the GSW-C
				   library less gsw_saar.
gsw_oceanographic_toolbox-head	-- Used to build gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c.
gsw_oceanographic_toolbox-tail	-- Used to build gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c.
gsw_saar.c			   gsw_saar and gsw_deltasa_atlas (modified).
gsw_saar_data.c			-- static global absolute salinity anomaly data
				   used by gsw_saar.c
gswteos-10.h			-- GSW function prototype definitions
libgswteos-10.spec.proto	-- template used to create libgswteos-10.spec,
				   the configuration file for rpmbuild on RedHat
				   Linux platforms.
LICENSE				-- GSW C software license.
make_check_data.py		-- Utility to generate gsw_check_data.c from
				   gsw_data_v3_0.nc.
Makefile			-- makefile supplied in the teos-10.org
				   distribution.
make_saar_data.py		-- Utility to generate gsw_saar_data.c from
				   gsw_data_v3_0.nc.
README				-- The README file distributed with the
				   teos-10.org distribution.
README-developer		-- This file.
toolbox				-- The actual source for GSW-C.
				   gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c is generated from
				   the contents of this directory by the
				   supplied GNUmakefile.

The file GNUmakefile is supplied for use on Linux/GNU systems. It has three
major purposes:

    * To rebuild gsw_oceanographic_toolbox.c from toolbox/*.c in the event of a
      change;
    * To build a zip archive of the distribution suitable for TEOS-10.org; and
    * To set up a versioned source distribution suitable for building source
      and binary RPMs on RedHat-like Linux systems.
	* To build for debugging, include "DEBUG=1" as an argument to make, e.g.,
	  "make DEBUG=1 -f GNUmakefile".

Please note that the current distribution on teos-10.org
(http://teos-10.org/software/gsw_c_v3.05.zip) is a subset of this github
directory and is accurately described by the supplied README file.
